            We have come across a few instances of fraudsters posing as Galaxy
            TechWorks and asking for payment from gullible investors against the
            promise of a Laptop Galaxy franchise. We, therefore, caution and
            urge all interested parties to be careful and vigilant and interact
            only with the email ID mentioned above. Anyone dealing with such
            fraudsters shall be doing so at their own peril, risk, and
            consequences.

          <p>
            Neither Galaxy TechWorks nor its Directors/Officers shall be
            responsible for any loss, harm, damage, or fraud that occurs or may
            occur or arise to any person who decides to access such fake
            websites or deal with them.

            Public at large is cautioned not to share these details with anyone
            over the phone or email as this could lead to fraud. Laptop Galaxy
            never asks for any confidential information. It is further notified
